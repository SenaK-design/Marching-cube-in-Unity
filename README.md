# Marching-cube-in-Unity

Here are some source code about marching cubes on Github.(Have tested in Unity2018 and Unity2019)It includes two version(CPU and GPU) which is the foundation of my Test417(https://twitter.com/i/status/1220778085798137856) and 
Test440(https://twitter.com/i/status/1169084756908105729).
Any ideas to optimize the GPU version is really appreciate.

Performance: In Gpu version ,run 80 * 80 * 80 voxel at 80 fps in average.

The scene include two main scripts,can easily assign different material to acheive different effect.
The gif has assigned a SSS material for testing.
